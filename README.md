### TODO

1. Create a text-only classifier for MOSI based on a pre-trained transformer (record test results)
2. Get shap values, you should be able to plot them by word, or also by time segment, for a sample
3. Try creating a classifier trained on the training data (record results like above)

specifically look for examples that classifiers do poorly on, and if they
benefit from modes. can look at shap vals on these

id like to make a helper where i can give a video id
and segment and it retrieves the original video to play.
